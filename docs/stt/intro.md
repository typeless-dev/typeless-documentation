# Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on Medical Speech to Text SDKs. In this introduction, we'll outline the essential components and functionalities of our speech recognition solutions designed specifically for the medical field.

**[WebSocket API](/docs/stt/ws_api.md)** is a real-time transcription service that ensures that spoken words are converted into text instantaneously, allowing for seamless integration into medical records or live captioning during medical procedures.

Have a look at [our supported languages](/docs/stt/languages) to see which languages are supported by our speech recognition services.

We provide a comprehensive list of [SDKs](/docs/category/websocket-sdks/) (Software Development Kits) to interface seamlessly with the WebSocket API. These SDKs are designed to facilitate easy integration of our speech-to-text capabilities into various medical software systems, enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Whether you're developing a telemedicine platform, a digital health record system, or other medical applications, our SDKs provide the necessary tools to incorporate advanced real-time speech recognition functionalities into your software.

We also guide you through the process of [authenticating](/docs/stt/authentif) the client requests through your backend with key-based authentication and providing a unique identifier for each user.
